-- SQL Advent Calendar - Day 11
-- Title: Winter Market Sweater Search
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- At the winter market, Cindy Lou is browsing the clothing inventory and wants to find all items with "sweater" in their name. But the challenge is the color and item columns have inconsistent capitalization. Can you write a query to return only the sweater names and their cleaned-up colors.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: winter_clothing
--   item_id: INT
--   item_name: VARCHAR
--   color: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
  item_id,
  SUBSTR(UPPER(color), 1, 1) || 
    SUBSTR(lower(color),2,LENGTH(color)-1) AS color_cleaned,
  item_name
FROM winter_clothing
WHERE lower(item_name) LIKE '%sweater%'
