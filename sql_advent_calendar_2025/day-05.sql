-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
  elves.elf_name, 
  vacations.start_date, 
  CASE 
      WHEN vacations.return_date IS NULL THEN 'Still resting'
      ELSE vacations.return_date
  END AS return_date
 
FROM elves LEFT JOIN vacations ON elves.elf_id = vacations.elf_id
