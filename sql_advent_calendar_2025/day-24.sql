-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH completed_goals_per_user AS  (
-- Get completed goal counts per user_id 
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    user_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN goal_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 END) AS completed_goals
  FROM user_goals
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
  user_type,
  ROUND(AVG(completed_goals),2)
FROM completed_goals_per_user
GROUP BY user_type
